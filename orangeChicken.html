        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>Orange chicken is a Chinese American restaurant classic, featuring crispy fried chicken tossed in a sticky, 
            savory citrus sauce and garnished with chiles and green onions. But, if you’ve only ever had it for takeout 
            or delivery, some would argue you’ve been missing out.</p>

        <p> “There's something to be said for the delicate balance of take-out-style orange chicken when it comes right out of the pan,” 
            says food writer and cookbook author Genevieve Ko, who developed this recipe. “You get the sauciness and the crunch all at the same time.
            But a half hour later, forget it. It’s so much better right out of the pan.” Happily, bringing the Chinese take-out staple home 
            is easier than you may think.</p>

        <h4>Start the chicken:</h4>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
            In a shallow, medium bowl toss the chicken pieces with the soy sauce and wine. Let stand while you make the sauce.
        </p>

        <h4>Make the orange sauce:</h4>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>Using a vegetable peeler, remove 4 lengthwise strips of zest from 1 orange—each strip should be about ¾-inch wide 
            and 3½- to 4-inches long. Arrange the zest in one layer between paper towels and microwave on high in 20-second 
            increments until dry and brittle but not browned, 60 to 80 seconds total. Let the zest cool then finely chop it. 
            If desired, use a Microplane to remove some of the remaining zest from the orange and reserve it for garnish. 
            (If desired, zest the second orange for additional garnish.)</p>
        
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>Squeeze enough juice from both oranges to measure ½ cup. In a small bowl, whisk together the juice and 2 
            teaspoons cornstarch until the cornstarch is dissolved.</p>

        <h5>Step 4</h5>
        <p>In a 10-inch skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add the garlic, ginger, 
            crushed red pepper, and dried orange zest and stir-fry until golden, about 30 seconds. Add the soy sauce, wine, 
            vinegar, and sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves, about 5 seconds. Stir the orange juice–cornstarch mixture 
            then add it to the skillet. Bring the sauce to a boil, stirring, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, 
            for 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat and set it aside while you fry the chicken.</p>

        <h4>Fry the chicken:</h4>    
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
        <p>Line a large rimmed baking sheet with paper towels.</p>

        <h5>Step 6</h5>
        <p>In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, heat ½ inch of oil until a deep-fry thermometer registers 365°F. Meanwhile, coat half 
            of the chicken, a couple pieces at a time, in cornstarch, making sure they are well coated and gently knocking off 
            any excess, then transfer to a plate. Carefully add all the coated chicken to the hot oil, spacing the pieces apart 
            from each other. Fry the chicken, turning it once or twice, until deep golden, about 5 minutes. While frying, adjust 
            the heat as necessary to keep the oil at 365°F. Using a metal spider or a slotted spoon, transfer the chicken as done 
            to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Continue to coat and fry the remaining chicken in the same manner, returning the 
            oil to 365°F between batches.</p>

         <h5>Step 7</h5>   
         <p>Once the chicken is fried, place the skillet of reserved orange sauce over moderately low heat and bring it to a simmer, 
            stirring and thinning the sauce with a little water if necessary. Add the chicken, and stir until thoroughly coated in sauce.</p>

        <h4>To serve:</h4>
        <h5>Step 8</h5>
        <p>Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and garnish with the scallions, and, if desired, the red chile slices and the freshly grated 
           orange zest. Serve immediately with rice.</p>
