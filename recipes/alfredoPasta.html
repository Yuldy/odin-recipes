        <h3>Cook Fettucine Pasta:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep pan or a sauce pan on the stovetop add 6 cups of water and 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of salt.</li>

            <li>Stir, turn the heat onto high and bring the water to a boil. </li>

            <li>Once the water is to a full boil, add the 226 grams (½ a pound or 8 ounces) of fettuccine pasta or other pasta of choice.</li>

            <li>Use a spoon to push the fettuccine down into the boiling water as they soften, until fully submerged.</li>

            <li>Continue to boil the pasta on medium to high heat.</li>

            <li>Cook according to package instructions, until the pasta is just al dente. That means cooked through but with a slight bite – so that the pasta are still toothsome.</li>

            <li>Drain the water, making sure to save and set aside about a ½ cup of the cooked pasta water. You might want to use a bit to thin out the alfredo sauce.</li>

        <h3>Alfredo Sauce Recipe</h3>

            <li>While the pasta is boiling, start to prepare the alfredo sauce. In a medium, deep skillet melt 3 to 4 tablespoons of salted or unsalted butter 
                (approximately 40 grams) on low heat. If using salted butter you’ll want to add less salt to finish the dish.</li>

            <li>Once the butter has melted, add ½ a teaspoon of chopped garlic. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic.</li>

            <li>Next add 1 cup of heavy whipping cream.</li>

            <li>Mix well with a wired whisk. Bring the cream to a gentle boil on low heat. Use a whisk and continuously stir as you bring the cream 
                mixture to a low simmer. Keep an eye on the cream to make sure it does not get brown or burnt.</li>

            <li>After the cream begins to gently boil, further simmer for 1 to 2 minutes, until the cream thickens a bit.</li>

            <li>Then add 6 tablespoons (50 grams) of grated vegetarian parmesan cheese to the pan.</li>

            <li>Mix well to combine the cheese with the cream.</li>

        <h3>Make Fettucine Alfredo</h3>

            <li>Now add the cooked and drained pasta to the prepared alfredo sauce in the pan.</li>

            <li>Once the water is to a full boil, add the 226 grams (½ a pound or 8 ounces) of fettuccine pasta or other pasta of choice.</li>
            <p> <img src = "https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fettuccine-alfredo02.jpg" width = "300" height = "200"> </p>

            <li>Use tongs to thoroughly mix the pasta and sauce together, so that every noodle is coated in creamy alfredo.</li>

            <li>Continue to cook the fettuccine alfredo on low heat for another minute or two, stirring frequently to keep the pasta from sticking together. 
            If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water, and stir.</li>

            <li>Taste the dish, and season with salt according to your taste preferences and a ¼ teaspoon of crushed black pepper. I also recommend 
            adding a light grating of fresh nutmeg for an earthy, aromatic pop of flavor.</li>

            <li>Mix the fettuccine alfredo again, and turn off the heat.</li>

        <h3>How to Serve</h3>

            <li>Serve the pasta hot. I like to garnish fettuccine alfredo with a tablespoon of grated vegetarian parmesan cheese and 1 to 2 teaspoons of chopped parsley, fresh or dried.</li>
            <p>Leftovers will keep well stored in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator. On refrigeration the pasta will thicken, so while reheating add a splash of 
            milk or water to thin the consistency slightly.</p>
